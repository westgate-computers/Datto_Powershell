.SYNOPSIS
This Powershell script is designed to be run on a supported (by Microsoft) Windows host. It checks for the most common issues that may prevent successful credentialed scans by Nessus.

.DESCRIPTION
This script checks for the following items:
 - Local Admin User/Group Requirements
 - Ensure Remote Shares are Available (Client or Server)
 - Windows Remote Registry Service Should be Enabled or Manual
 - Windows Server Service Must be Enabled
 - WMI Service Must be Enabled
 - Users must authenticate as themselves, not Guest
 - Minimum Windows Firewall Checks
   - Windows Management Instrumentation (DCOM-In)
   - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI-In)
   - Windows Management Instrumentation (ASync-In)
   - File and Printer Sharing (SMB-In)
 - Windows 10 > 1709 Auth Issues (SPN Validation)
 - Symantec Endpoint Scan Blocking
 - UAC Remote Auth Token Validation

Note:
 - This should be run with administrative privileges in the x64 Powershell console/construct.
 - The PowerShell Execution Policies may have to be changed to allow the script to run
 - No changes are made to the target system. Review the output and manually make any changes required.
 - You must pass the usernames of the account(s) authorized to run the Nessus check in order to run the assessment.
    - If a user/group is nested, pass the top level group expected to be on the target system.
 - This script may not identify all issues that prevent successful credentialed scans, but highlights the most common ones. If you have suggestions for additional checks, please log an issue.
 - This script may identify settings that do not need to be adjusted due to other system configurations. Where known, these details are called out in the notes of the check; please review them carefully.

.PARAMETER ScanningAccounts
Specifies the scanning accounts being used. Can accept multiple values comma separated

.EXAMPLE
.\credential_check.ps1 -ScanningAccounts "vuln_scan"

Runs an assessment given the local "vuln_scan" account is authorized for vulnerability assessments.

.EXAMPLE
.\credential_check.ps1 -ScanningAccounts "vuln_scan","DOMAIN\vuln_scan","DOMAIN\Vuln Scanning Group"

Runs an assessment given the following accounts are authorized for vulnerability assessments:
Local User: "vuln_scan"
Domain User: "DOMAIN\vuln_scan"
Domain User Group: "DOMAIN\Vuln Scanning Group"

.EXAMPLE
PS C:\>.\credential_check.ps1 -ScanningAccounts "vuln_scan" *> Nessus_Credential_Check_Status.txt  

Push the output to a file so you have a standalone report.

.EXAMPLE
Invoke-Command -ComputerName 203.0.113.5 -FilePath .\credential_check.ps1 -ScanningAccounts "vuln_scan"

Run the script on a remote system. This assumes Remote PowerShell Management is configured properly and working.
